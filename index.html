                    <p class="anime-banner-synopsis">Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by
                        monstrous humanoid creatures called
                        Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants
                        truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears
                        to
                        be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within
                        defensive
                        barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile
                        calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer
                        wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

                        After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager
                        dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military
                        unit
                        that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted
                        sister
                        Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans
                        and
                        race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

                    <p class="anime-banner-synopsis">
                        It has been two and a half years since Naruto Uzumaki left Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf
                        Village, for intense training following events which fueled his desire to be stronger. Now
                        Akatsuki, the mysterious organization of elite rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan
                        which may threaten the safety of the entire shinobi world.

                        Although Naruto is older and sinister events loom on the horizon, he has changed little in
                        personality—still rambunctious and childish—though he is now far more confident and possesses an
                        even greater determination to protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto will carry
                        on with the fight for what is important to him, even at the expense of his own body, in the
                        continuation of the saga about the boy who wishes to become Hokage.

                        Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji
                        Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden
                        grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he
                        unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji
                        finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice
                        and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon
                        Sukuna Ryoumen, the King of Curses.

                        Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own
                        newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, he begins to walk down
                        a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.

                        Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the family has fallen upon Tanjirou
                        Kamado's shoulders. Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able
                        to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local
                        village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou
                        to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating
                        demons that lurk in the woods at night.

                        When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole
                        family has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been
                        turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to avenge his
                        family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves
                        the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the
                        remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.

                    <p class="anime-banner-synopsis">
                        Yoichi Isagi was mere moments away from scoring a goal that would have sent his high school
                        soccer team to the nationals, but a split-second decision to pass the ball to his teammate cost
                        him that reality. Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have
                        been different had he not made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from
                        the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process,
                        Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue
                        Lock.

                        The project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the
                        Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete
                        against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside
                        his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even
                        if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.

                        Having slept through all four of her alarms, the energetic Narumi Momose finds herself running
                        late for her first day of work at a new office. As she races to catch her train, she makes a
                        promise to herself that none of her coworkers will find out about her dark secret: that she is
                        an otaku and a fujoshi. Her plan goes instantly awry, though, when she runs into Hirotaka
                        Nifuji, an old friend from middle school. Although she tries to keep her secret by inviting him
                        out for drinks after work, her cover is blown when he casually asks her whether or not she will
                        be attending the upcoming Summer Comiket. Luckily for her, the only witnesses—Hanako Koyanagi
                        and Tarou Kabakura—are otaku as well.
                        
                        Later that night, the pair go out for drinks so that they can catch up after all the years
                        apart. After Narumi complains about her previous boyfriend breaking up with her because he
                        refused to date a fujoshi, Hirotaka suggests that she try dating a fellow otaku, specifically
                        himself. He makes a solemn promise to always be there for her, to support her, and to help her
                        farm for rare drops in Monster Hunter. Blown away by the proposal, Narumi agrees immediately.
                        Thus the two otaku start dating, and their adorably awkward romance begins.
